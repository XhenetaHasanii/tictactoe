# TicTacToe Console Game

Implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe as a console game in Java.

Learning and manipulating 2D Arrays.

An idea on improving this application is by building a GUI Application using JavaFX.

The game field is a 2x2 array (0 until 2 for row and for column coordinate).

A sample picture of the console game:
